So first I downloaded the Census file we agreed upon in class. I have a path outside of the repository because the file is too big to upload to github.

I imported the file and print it out.  It's too big so is summarized in the notbook with rows and columns replaced by dots.

I went to the orginal notebook and saw how to print out the just the column names, so I did that.

Most of the columns are too fine to do a fequency analysis.  The first colum isn't (has only 15 values) so I can do a frequency analysis.

I used the code that was in the notebook you pointed us to to build "freq" for PPPOS column (which I don't know what it is).

I then made a bar graph.
